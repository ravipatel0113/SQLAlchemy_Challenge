# SQLAlchemy_Challenge

The SQL Alchemy Challenge is completed in just the way asked to do.
The folder contain the jupyter notebook for the climate starter and the bonus part I and part II.

The app.py file contain the flask method and all the routes required for.

In the app.py file when runned the last route which does the same thing as the start_date route does, but this takes an user input for the process you run.

While running the last routes pleas keep and eye on the terminal where it will ask to enter the start date.

P.S: Running only that part of the code may required to re-run the code again. Other part of the code will run smooth in the single try.
